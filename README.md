# Novella
The Novella IDE for creative writing and development. 

This is the core novella server (the kernel). Written in Rust. UI clients can communicate with its gRPC powered API. A simple client written in Qt is being developed as well.
## Warning!
This project is in extremely early stages, and is mostly a learning experience for the author.
