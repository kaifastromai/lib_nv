# Novella
This is the core novella library, that contained almost exclusively rust code. 

This exposes an api for interaction from possibly various languages. This is marks significant change in the architecture of the program, hopefully for the better.
## Warning!
This project is in extremely early stages, and is mostly a learning experience for the author.
