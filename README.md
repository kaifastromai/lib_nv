# Novella
This is the core novella library. It is written almost entirely in rust.

It exposes a C++ (and C?) API for interaction from possibly various other languages. This marks significant change in the architecture of the program, hopefully for the better.
## Warning!
This project is in extremely early stages, and is mostly a learning experience for the author. Expecting it to even build at this point is very generous of you!
